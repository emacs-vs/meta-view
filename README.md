View assembly metadata, and it's documentation from a C# project, generated
by Visual Studio IDE (not VSCode).

*P.S. This package mimics the [MetadataSource](https://github.com/dotnet/roslyn/tree/main/src/Features/Core/Portable/MetadataAsSource)
feature from Visual Studio IDE*

## üíæ Usage

### :mag: 1. Open a C# file

Make sure the `.cs` file is a valid source file under a C# project.

### :mag: 2. View assembly metadata!

Navigate to a symbol you want to search, then call `M-x meta-view-at-point`.

## :hammer: Configurations

#### `meta-view-active-modes`

Major modes that allow to view metadata source, default is `csharp-mode`.

#### `meta-view-after-insert-hook`

Hooks run after buffer is inserted to display view, default is `nil`.

For example, display line numbers for metadata buffer. (on left)

```el
(add-hook 'meta-view-after-insert-hook
          (lambda ()
            (display-line-numbers-mode 1)))
```

| Display Line Numbers         | Advance                       |
|------------------------------|-------------------------------|
| <img src="./etc/dis-ln.png"> | <img src="./etc/advance.png"> |

You can fold all comments by your favorite folding package. (on right)

#### `meta-view-display-function`

Function call to display reference data, default to `#'switch-to-buffer`.
